While working through some codewars exercises, I came across this problem of a Ceaser Cipher, which rotates characters by +13, so a "t" becomes a "g". 


### The problem:


>ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is an example of the Caesar cipher.

>Create a function that takes a string and returns the string ciphered with Rot13. If there are numbers or special characters included in the string, they should be returned as they are. Only letters from the latin/english alphabet should be shifted, like in the original Rot13 "implementation".


### My problem

As usual I used a pretty verbose method to solve it:

~~~ruby
def rot13(string)
  letters_down = ('a'..'z').to_a
  letters_up = ('A'..'Z').to_a
  new_string = ""
  string.chars.map do |x|
    if letters_down.include?(x)
      new_string << letters_down[letters_down.find_index(x) + 13 - letters_down.size]
    elsif letters_up.include?(x)
      new_string << letters_up[letters_up.find_index(x) + 13 - letters_up.size]
    else
      new_string << x
    end
  end
  new_string
end
~~~

It works. But as always with me and ruby, there is a cleaner and shorter way. 


### The solution

This is not neccessarily idiomatic, but it is clever. Posted by several users.

~~~ruby
def rot13(string)
  string.tr("A-Za-z", "N-ZA-Mn-za-m")
end
~~~

Basically just translating a shifted array. Probably not good for large projects but gets the job done here!

Great stuff.
