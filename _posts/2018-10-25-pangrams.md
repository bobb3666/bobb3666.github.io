![A pangram](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTc2NI_XcAAxsIY.jpg)

Another workthrough in ruby for the pangram problem from the ruby track on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/).

## The problem
"Determine if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma, "every letter") is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. The best known English pangram is:

    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

The alphabet used consists of ASCII letters a to z, inclusive, and is case insensitive. Input will not contain non-ASCII symbols."

## My Solution

I used the following to get to the bottom of this:

~~~ruby
class Pangram
  def self.pangram?(sentence)
    missing_letters = []
    ('a'..'z').each do |letter|
      next if sentence.downcase.include?(letter)
      missing_letters << letter
    end
    missing_letters.empty? ? true : false
  end
end
~~~

I was pretty happy with that effort but.........

Upon uploading, and gaining access to community solutions, I came across this succinct solution, by user @NickSchimek, which I have changed just slightly

~~~ruby
class Pangram
  def self.pangram?(phrase)
    ('a'..'z').all? { |char| phrase.downcase.include?(char) }
  end
end
~~~

A great example of streamlining some code.

Nice.
